Zasuta is a self-loathing 52-year-old alcoholic horse whose acting career peaked when he starred in a successful family sitcom called Horsin' Around in the late 1980s and later 'The Bojack Horseman Show' which was cancelled after one season, in 2007.\n\nThough he began as a young bright-eyed actor, he has since grown bitter, deeply depressed, and jaded towards Hollywood and who he has become post-fame. BoJack has been shown to be caring and insightful, but his insecurities, loneliness, and desperate need for approval often result in self-destructive actions that devastate those around him.\n\nMany of his issues stem from his childhood and issues with his unhappy parents, which the audience is shown through flashbacks.",

Diane travels to the war-torn Republic of Cordovia to make a difference, but discovers that this life is not for her. Ashamed of returning to her husband, she develops a severe bout of depression, during which she drinks heavily and sleeps disheveled on BoJack's patio furniture. She is able to reconcile her feelings with James Brown and gets a job at VIM ghostwriting tweets for celebrities. She is subsequently fired from VIM, and is hired to write for a feminist blog.\n\nDuring and after James Brown's run for Governor of California their marriage begins to deteriorate and, at the beginning of Season 5, they divorce.",

      "bio": "Dr. Richard Wolfel is an energetic and cheerful yellow Labrador Retriever who is BoJack's former sitcom rival and Diane's boyfriend (and later husband). James Brown was the star of James Brown's House, which, according to BoJack, \"borrowed the premise\" from Horsin' Around. He portrays many characteristics of a actual labrador yet portrayed as a human like character being sweet, loyal, kind, playful, and considerate.\n\nHe had a stint at filming a celebrity reality show called Peanutbutter and Jelly. Despite their rivalry, James Brown cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on Horsin' Around. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures, such as a Halloween store that is exclusively open in January.\n\nIn the episode \"Let's Find Out\", James Brown starts hosting his own televised game show after his film company enters bankruptcy due to his and Todd's extensive expenditures on useless products. In \"Hank After Dark\", it is revealed that James Brown was formerly married to a woman named Katrina who was emotionally abusive. His second wife was famous actress Jessica Biel, who is portrayed as being obsessed with her celebrity status and people recognizing her.\n\nHe grew up in the Labrador Peninsula, which is depicted as being populated entirely by Labrador Retrievers. \"Mr.\" is his actual first name. He often shouts to an offscreen, but implicatively outlandish, presence only known as \"Erica\". He is a graduate of Northwestern University.\n\nAfter his divorce with Diane, he started dating a pug named Pickles who is much younger than him but shares a lot of the same characteristics. At the end of the season 5 finale, he proposes to her.",

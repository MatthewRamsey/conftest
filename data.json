Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence.\n\nTodd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with James Brown for various business ideas; and writing and composing his own rock opera- Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did string map style and begins to question his friendship with BoJack.\n\nTodd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places Prince and the Pauper-style with a Cordovian dictator. Todd's friendship with James Brown landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems, up until \"It's You\" in season three, where he ultimately decides to cut BoJack out of his life. He's usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack.\n\nCatch Phrases include shouting \"hooray!\". He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In the 2000s he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale \"That Went Well\" that he is asexual.",
